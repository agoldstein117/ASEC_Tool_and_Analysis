# ASEC_Tool_and_Analysis

##Summary 

The goal of this project was to create a tool that others could use for future projects relating to the Census Bureau's Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC). The ASEC provides survey answers from hundreds of thousands of individuals within the US. The ASEC collects information from 245k unique individuals on topics relating to their work, income, noncash benefits, migration, demographics, and other related topics. The ASEC contains over 900 different variables available for a wide variety of analyses. Until 2019, the Census Bureau provided this data in CSV form, making it more easily usable for python-based projects. The information is categorized into three distinct CSVs personal, family, and household.

The personal CSV relates to a singular respondent’s personal information. This is the CSV where you would find individual income, an individual’s demo graphic information, their occupational history, or their educational history. The family CSV contains information regarding an individual family unit, such as number of individuals in a family, family composition type, and total family income. The household information contains information regarding total household income, number of individuals in the household, and the specific geographic information related to individuals and families.
